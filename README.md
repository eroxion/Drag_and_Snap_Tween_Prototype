# Drag and Snap Tween Prototype

## Project Description
This is a **Drag and Snap Tween Prototype** inspired by [Going Home](http://goinghome.302chanwoo.com/), built entirely from scratch by **Anusheel Soni**. The project features a **smooth snapping mechanism** where draggable pieces automatically animate to their designated positions when released within a valid range.

## Features
- **Mouse-based dragging and dropping** of pieces.
- **Snapping mechanism**:
  - If a piece is dropped within a predefined region, it **animates its movement** to snap into place.
  - **Smooth transition animations** for realistic movement.
- **Position recognition system** to determine if a piece is within the required range before snapping.
- **Automatic transform animation** ensuring fluid movement to the final position.

## Unity Version
This project was developed using **Unity 6 (6000.0.37f1)**.

## Project Structure
The repository contains only three folders:
- `Assets`
- `Packages`
- `ProjectSettings`

Anyone can clone this repository and open it directly in Unity 6 to try out the project.
